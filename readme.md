# LobbyPlag Sites

This repository contains the websites of the [LobbyPlag](http://www.lobbyplag.eu/) project and scripts to update them.

## Frontends

Currently there are `browse` and `research` which correspondent to [LobbyPlag Browse](http://browse.lobbyplag.eu/) and [LobbyPlag Research](http://research.lobbyplag.eu/).

## Generators

These directories hold the scripts to transform data from the [Data Repository](https://github.com/lobbyplag/lobbyplag-data) to the data formats the sites use.

There is also a generator for `plag`, which will eventually replace the main site.
